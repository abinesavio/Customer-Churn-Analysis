# Customer Churn Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive customer churn analysis project utilizing Python and various data analysis techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers ceasing their relationship with a business.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze and understand the factors influencing customer churn within a telecommunications company. By leveraging Python and its data analysis libraries, we delve into the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could help mitigate customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a telecommunications company and contains various features related to customer demographics, services subscribed, contract details, payment methods, and churn status. It includes information such as:

- Customer demographics (gender, age, etc.)
- Subscription details (contract type, internet service, etc.)
- Billing information (monthly charges, total charges, payment methods, etc.)
- Churn status (whether the customer churned or not)

## Key Features

This project analyzes various aspects related to customer churn, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of different features.
- Comparative analysis of churned and retained customers.
- Identification of key factors contributing to churn.
- Statistical analysis to uncover correlations and patterns.
- Visualization of insights using plots and charts.

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization

## Usage

To explore the project, simply clone this repository and open the provided Jupyter Notebook file (`Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. Follow the step-by-step analysis and execute the code cells to replicate the results.
